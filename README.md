## Configuration (Optional) üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Mate starter is a SPA (Single Page Application), so basically you have only two pages:

- `Main.js`: portfolio itself
- `404.js`: 404 error page with the same style

The structure for the main page is the following:

```javascript
<Layout>
  <Landing />
  <About />
  <Projects />
  <Writing />
</Layout>
```

`Layout` is the core of the application, it manages the theme for the application, the navigation between sections, also it defines the `header`.

All the components inside `Layout` are `Section` components. A section can have a link inside the `Header` or not, in order to add you need to wrapped the exported `Section` with `withNavigation` HOC and it will be automatically registered (Context magic ‚ú®).
